<h3>Mathematics Behind a Solution</h3>
<p>If $T(n)$ is the n-th triangular number, then we know that</p>
<p>\[T(n)=1+2+\cdots+n=\sum_{i=1}^n=\frac{n(n+1)}{2}.\]</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s assume that we know the prime factorizations of both $n$ and $n+1$, and we&#8217;ll write</p>
<p>\[n = p_1^{e_1}p_2^{e_2}\cdots p_s^{e^s}\quad\text{and}\quad n+1 = q_1^{f_1}q_2^{f_2}\cdots q_t^{f_t}\]</p>
<p>Notice that $n$ and $n+1$ cannot share any prime factors (as they are consecutive numbers), and so we know that all the $p_i$ and $q_i$ are distinct primes. Also, one and only one of $n$ and $n+1$ are divisible by 2. The exponents $e_i$ and $f_i$ are therefore the only things we really need to consider in order to determine the number of divisors of $T(n)$. The fact that $T(n)=(n(n+1))/2$ means that we&#8217;ll need to neglect a single power of two in the factorization of $n$ or $n+1$ (remember, only one is even). Let&#8217;s assume, without loss of generality, that $n$ is even and that $p_1=2$. Then, some quick combinatorics tell us that the total number of factors of $T(n)$ will be</p>
<p>\[(e_1)(e_2+1)\cdots(e_s+1)(f_1+1)(f_2+1)\cdots(f_t+1)=e_1\prod_{i=2}^s(e_i+1)\prod_{i=1}^t(f_i+1)\]</p>
<p>Even better, as we&#8217;re increasing our triangular numbers looking for the first one to satisfy the property in question, we only need to calculate the factorization of $n+1$ (as we already know that factorization of $n$, as it was previously $n+1$). This should decrease the runtime substantially.</p>
